# Orales One Market

A curated app store for the **Olares One** — the first Olares hardware device, packing an RTX 5090M, 96GB DDR5, and a 24-core Intel CPU into a compact form factor.

Every app here is hand-tuned for this exact hardware. No generic configs — just the fastest possible inference on 24GB of GDDR7.

> **One-click install.** Add the market source, and apps appear in your Olares Market alongside the official catalog.

## Apps

### LLM Inference

| App | Model | Speed | Details |
|-----|-------|-------|---------|
| **Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B** | 30B params, 3B active (MoE) | **184 t/s** | Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL, llama.cpp b8334 |
| **Qwen3.5 35B-A3B** | 35B params, 3B active (MoE) | **129 t/s** | Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL, llama.cpp b8334 |
| **Qwen3.5 35B-A3B Vision** | 35B params, 3B active + mmproj | **131 t/s** | UD-Q4_K_XL + mmproj F16, multimodal |
| **Qwen3.5 27B** | 27B dense | Experimental | vLLM, NVFP4, speculative decoding |

Full-size MoE models running entirely on GPU at speeds that rival much smaller dense models.

### Creative

| App | Model | Features |
|-----|-------|----------|
| **Qwen3-TTS 1.7B** | Text-to-speech | 9 premium voices, zero-shot voice cloning from 3s of audio, 10 languages |
| **ComfyUI** | Image generation | Full ComfyUI node editor, cluster mode for Olares One |

## Quick Start

Add this URL as a market source in **Olares Market > Settings > Add Source**:

```
https://orales-one-market.aamsellem.workers.dev
```

Apps show up within 5 minutes. Install like any other Olares app — models download automatically on first launch.

## How It Works

A single Cloudflare Worker serves the full Olares Market Source API. Each app is a Helm chart with GPU-optimized configs, packaged and deployed from this repo.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # Local dev (localhost:8787)
npm run deploy           # Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```

### Adding an app

1. Create an app directory with `Chart.yaml`, `OlaresManifest.yaml`, and `templates/`
2. Add an icon in `icons/<app-name>.png`
3. Package: `helm package <app-dir> -d charts/`
4. Deploy: `npm run deploy`
